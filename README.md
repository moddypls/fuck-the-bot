# fuck-the-bot
userscript to get rid of the bot - work in progress as long as i feel like it



# How to set it up...

1.  Install the browser plug-in Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey (preferably the former if available) onto the browser you are using discord on

2.  Find the icon of the newly installed extension and click on it. You'll find a button called "New user script..." or "Create a new script...".<br>Click on it

3.  A text editor will open up. All you have to do is delete all pregenerated text and insert <a target="_blank" title="the userscript" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moddypls/fuck-the-bot/main/userscript.js">the text provided by this repository</a>

4.  Then just click Ctrl+S to save and you're done

If there are any problems check this repo for changes and update your script or lmk
Sometimes refreshing discord also helps.

# Updating your script...

1.  Find the icon of Greasemonkey or Tempermonkey in your menu of installed extensions

2.  * for Greasemonkey: 
      1. Click onto the button with the name of the userscript (default: Antispam Prot)
      2. Replace all text with the <a target="_blank" title="the userscript" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moddypls/fuck-the-bot/main/userscript.js">new one provided by this repo</a>
      3. Ctrl+S to save
    * for Tampermonkey: 
      1. Click onto the button that has the label Dashboard on it
      2. Click onto the Edit Symbol on the right, in the "Actions"-column, to the left of the deletion symbol (See image below)
      4. Replace all text with the <a target="_blank" title="the userscript" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moddypls/fuck-the-bot/main/userscript.js">new one provided by this repo</a>

also lmk if you have any suggestions/ideas.<br>
this script can technically work for any user you want to block without using the built-in block function from discord
